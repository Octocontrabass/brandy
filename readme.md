Brandy
======

Brandy is a tool to analyze the copy protection mechanisms from SCO Xenix and
other contemporary SCO software.

Brandy can:

 * Analyze encrypted files to determine the product code
 * Create new activation keys from serial number/product code pairs
 * Verify serial number/activation key pairs and extract the product code
 * Decrypt encrypted programs (without branding them)
 * Encrypt decrypted programs (without debranding them)
 * ~~Make Xenix stop crashing so much~~
 * Maybe other things, later.

Xenix is dead. Long live Xenix.
